<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build a high-converting, luxury-themed landing page for Rushabh Ventures. The project evolved through several requests:
- **Initial Build**: Create a frontend-only landing page with a luxury Executive Midnight theme, using mock data.
- **Design Refinements**: The user provided reference images to guide the UI/UX, requesting a more polished, sophisticated design. The hero section was specifically updated to a centered layout, and an initial 3D element was removed.
- **Page Expansion**: The user requested the creation of several new pages: 'About Us', 'Contact Us', 'Privacy Policy', and 'Terms & Conditions', with links in a shared footer.
- **Blog Section**: A blog section was added, including a blog list page and a single post page layout, populated with mock data.
- **Componentization**: The agent created shared , , and  components to ensure consistency across all pages. The header's Apply Now button was configured to scroll to the form on the homepage.
- **Content & Form Updates**: The 'About Us' content was replaced with user-provided text. The 'Contact Us' form fields were updated to specific requirements (Name, Company Name, Annual Turnover, Mobile, Email, Message). Website-wide content was updated to include Mainboard Companies in addition to SMEs.
- **Mobile Optimization**: The entire website was made mobile-responsive, and decorative elements on the hero banner were removed as per user screenshots.

**what currently exists?**
A fully responsive, multi-page React application for Rushabh Ventures. The application features a consistent luxury Executive Midnight dark theme across all pages (Home, About Us, Contact Us, Privacy/Terms, Blog). It uses shared Header, Footer, and CTA components. The entire application is currently frontend-only, with all dynamic content (like blog posts and form submissions) using mock data. The UI has been refined based on user feedback and is optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: Mobile optimization of the entire website and removal of decorative strokes from the hero banner, as requested by the user with reference images.
- **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool. The next agent should use the screenshot tool with various viewport sizes (e.g., 375px for mobile, 1440px for desktop) to confirm the responsiveness and design changes on key pages like Home, About Us, and Contact Us.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The last task is awaiting user feedback.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **P0: Backend Integration**: The highest priority is to make the application dynamic.
  - **Contact & Apply Forms**: Implement a backend endpoint (e.g., ) to handle form submissions from the Contact Us page and the homepage form. This should include data validation and storage in MongoDB.
  - **Blog API**: Create full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for blog posts.
  - **Frontend Integration**: Replace all mock data sources (, ) with  API calls to the new backend endpoints.
- **P1: Admin Features**: Create a simple, secure admin interface to allow the client to manage blog posts (create new posts, edit existing ones) without needing to modify the code.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Initial Landing Page Creation**: Built the  page with a luxury theme and mock data.
- **Multi-page Architecture**: Created , , , , , and .

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI (scaffolded, not yet integrated)
- **Database**: MongoDB (scaffolded, not yet integrated)
- **Design System**: A custom luxury theme (Executive Midnight) based on the green-dark-theme playbook, with a focus on dark backgrounds, high-contrast text, and a single brand accent color.

**key DB schema**
No application-specific schemas have been implemented yet. The following are proposed for the upcoming backend work:
- : 
- : 

**changes in tech stack**
- The  package was temporarily added for a 3D effect but was later removed at the user's request.

**All files of reference**
- : Contains all the routing logic for the pages.
- : Contains global styles, including the new mobile-responsive media queries.
- : The shared header component, updated for mobile responsiveness.
- : The shared footer component.
- : The shared Call-To-Action component.
- : Directory containing all created pages.
- : Mock data for the blog section.
- : The project requirements document, updated throughout the session.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The process of removing the old, duplicated footers from each page was inefficient, involving multiple file views and replacements. This suggests that future bulk file modifications should be handled with more precise  operations to improve efficiency.

**key api endpoints**
- None are currently implemented for the application's features.
- Proposed endpoints for next phase: , , .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The application is **frontend-only**. The immediate next step is to build and integrate the backend for the forms and blog.
- The user is highly focused on design and aesthetics. You must maintain the Executive Midnight luxury theme and ensure all new elements are fully responsive.
- Before finishing any backend-related task, you **MUST** use the  to ensure the frontend and backend are correctly integrated and functioning as expected.
